# Docker-Website-Deployment
This is a project in the domain of devops. In this project, I have cloned my portfolio website using CLI, and I have done all the things using CLI. 
I first made a template html file as my portfolio. 
Then i cloned it in my local system.
Using docker commands i have made an image from a Dockerfile. 
Using that dockerfile, I have made a container and then i ran container on port 8080. 
The port is running the website successfully. 

Hence I have successfully deployed an website over docker and containerized it.
